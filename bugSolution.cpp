To avoid unexpected behavior, it's best to avoid using iterators or pointers with `std::vector<bool>`.  If you need a compact way to store booleans, consider alternatives such as `std::vector<char>` (where each byte stores multiple booleans) or a more space-efficient custom implementation. For many use cases, the slight performance overhead is far outweighed by the increased safety and ease of understanding offered by these alternatives.
